Title of Project
Movie Recommendation System

Objective
To build a system that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and past ratings, thereby enhancing user experience and engagement on a movie streaming platform.

Data Source
The data is sourced from the MovieLens dataset, which contains millions of movie ratings from a diverse group of users.

 Import Library
Libraries include pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, and the Surprise library for building and evaluating recommendation systems.

Import Data
Load the MovieLens data using pandas to create dataframes for movies and ratings, enabling us to analyze and manipulate the data effectively.

Describe Data
Display the first few rows, summary statistics, and information about the datasets to understand the structure, distribution, and any potential issues in the data.

Data Visualization
Visualize the distribution of movie ratings, the number of ratings per movie, and other relevant insights to get a better understanding of user behavior and movie popularity.

Data Preprocessing
Merge movies and ratings dataframes, check for and handle missing values, and perform any necessary data cleaning to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)
In a recommendation system, traditional target and feature variables are not used. Instead, we utilize userId, movieId, and rating to train our model.

Train Test Split
Split the data into training and testing sets using the Surprise library, ensuring that our model is trained on one part of the data and evaluated on another to assess its performance accurately.

Modeling
Train the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model using the training data, leveraging collaborative filtering to predict user ratings for movies they haven't watched.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the accuracy of the predicted ratings compared to the actual ratings in the test set.

Prediction
Make predictions for specific user and movie pairs, demonstrating the model's capability to recommend movies based on a user's past behavior and preferences.

### Explanation
Provide a detailed explanation of findings, including the model's performance, the significance of the evaluation metrics, and any challenges faced during the project. Discuss potential improvements and future work to enhance the recommendation system further.
