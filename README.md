# Movie-Recommendation-System

The Movie Recommendation System uses the MovieLens dataset, containing millions of ratings from users. The data is preprocessed by merging movie information with ratings and handling any missing values. The SVD algorithm from the Surprise library is used to train the model, splitting the data into training and test sets. The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to determine its accuracy. Finally, the system can predict the rating a user might give to a specific movie, helping to recommend movies based on user preferences.

The model performed with an MSE of [your value], indicating a good level of accuracy in predicting user ratings. Future improvements could include incorporating additional features such as genres and user demographics to enhance the recommendations.
